# Top-Down RPG (UE5 + GAS)

A **work-in-progress** top-down action RPG built with **Unreal Engine 5** and the **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)**.

The goal of this project is to learn and build a flexible RPG foundation that can be expanded with features like inventory, quests, and AI.  
Itâ€™s based primarily on the following resources:

- ðŸ“º [Stephen Ulibarri's GAS tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-gas-top-down-rpg)
- ðŸ“˜ [Tranek's GAS Documentation](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation) â€” A highly recommended deep dive into GAS

---

## ðŸš§ Current Features (WIP)
- Top-down movement and basic camera
- Enemy highlighting using cursor detection + rendering effects (custom depth)
- Character stats and attributes
- Gameplay Ability System integration
- Item pickup system applying GAS effects and displaying UI messages
- Overlay UI follows an MVC pattern: a controller listens to GAS attribute changes and updates the view (widget) accordingly
- Modular code structure for future scalability
